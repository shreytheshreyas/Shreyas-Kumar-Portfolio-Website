  "aboutpara": "Growing up in Singapore, my journey in technology and engineering has been shaped by friends and mentors whose innovative spirit and inspiring ideas, combined with my diverse experiences, have driven me to harness technology for societal impact. My fascination with technology emerged in childhood, particularly with solutions that prioritize exceptional design and user experience. This passion was further fueled by my admiration of Apple's approach to technology â€“ where engaging, simple, and secure user experiences take center stage in their products. Now, I'm applying my expertise in software engineering and large-scale data systems to develop a platform addressing critical mental healthcare challenges, specifically targeting prohibitive costs, social stigma, and limited access to immediate professional support. This project embodies my vision of creating meaningful social impact through thoughtfully designed solutions.",
